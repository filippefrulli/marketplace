      <Section title="1. Who we are">
        <p>
          Caseros is an online marketplace connecting buyers with independent European artisans
          selling handmade and craft goods. References to "Caseros", "we", "us", or "our" in
          this policy refer to the operator of this platform. If you have questions about this
          policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@caseros.com" className="underline">privacy@caseros.com</a>.

      <Section title="2. Data we collect">
        <p>We collect and process the following categories of personal data:</p>

        <Subsection title="Account data">
          <p>
            When you register, we collect your email address and, optionally, your name and
            profile picture. We link your account to a Supabase authentication identifier.
          </p>
        </Subsection>

        <Subsection title="Buyer data">
          <p>
            If you make a purchase, we collect shipping addresses (street address, city, postal
            code, country) and retain a record of your orders, including the items purchased,
            prices paid, and order status. Payment card data is processed exclusively by Stripe
            and is never stored on our servers.
          </p>
        </Subsection>

        <Subsection title="Seller data">
          <p>
            If you open a shop, we collect your shop name, bio, avatar and banner images,
            country, preferred currency, and optional social media links. We also process
            Know Your Customer (KYC) information, which may include your full name, date of
            birth, address, and — for registered traders — a business registration number and
            contact details. A verification video may be requested and stored during the
            approval process.
          </p>
        </Subsection>

        <Subsection title="Communications">
          <p>
            Messages exchanged between buyers and sellers through the platform are stored in
            our database, including read receipts, so that both parties can access their
            conversation history.
          </p>
        </Subsection>

        <Subsection title="Usage data">
          <p>
            We record which listings you have saved as favourites and, if you leave a review,
            the content and rating of that review.
          </p>
        </Subsection>

        <Subsection title="Technical data">
          <p>
            Like most web services, our hosting infrastructure may log IP addresses, browser
            type, and request timestamps as part of normal server operation. We do not use
            third-party analytics or advertising trackers.
          </p>
        </Subsection>
      </Section>

      <Section title="3. How we use your data">
        <p>We use your personal data to:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">

          <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">
          We process your data on the legal bases of contract performance (to fulfil your
          orders or seller agreement), legal obligation (tax and KYC requirements), and
          legitimate interest (platform security and fraud prevention). Where required, we
          will ask for your explicit consent.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="4. Third parties we share data with">
        <p>We share personal data only with the following third parties and only to the extent necessary:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">

            <strong>Supabase</strong> — provides our authentication service and cloud database

            processing agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stripe</strong> — processes all payments and seller payouts. When you pay
            for an order or a seller connects a bank account, you interact directly with

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3">

          for advertising purposes.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="5. Data retention">
        <p>
          We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. Order records
          are retained for seven years to meet accounting and tax obligations. KYC records
          are retained as required by applicable anti-money-laundering regulations.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          You may request deletion of your account at any time (see section 6). Where we are
          required by law to retain certain records, we will retain only the minimum necessary
          data for the legally required period.
        </p>
